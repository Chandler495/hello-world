# hello-world
The start

Hi!
I'm Chandler. I'm still new (essentially) to coding and creating, but I've put together some things in Java that
I've used to help with research projects and I'm wanting do some more. I have no idea in what, or for what, yet,
so I'm kinda just following where the wind blows.
